# Danbury Artificial Intelligence
## Deep Learning Study Group
<img src="dai.png" width="250">

A repo for our deep learning book study group launched in October 2017. This is a living repo that is subject to rapid change. Also, most work is in progress, and nothing should be taken as final unless marked so. If you'd like to contribute, [join our meetup group]((https://www.meetup.com/DanburyAI/)) and message the organizers.

## Featured Jupyter Notebooks
In this group we aim to disseminate knowledge through code, prose, and mathematics -- a lovely combination that Jupyter Notebooks provide. Here are our best Notebooks so far.

## About Danbury AI
[Danbury AI](https://www.meetup.com/DanburyAI/) is a public AI meetup group hosted by the [Danbury Hackerspace](https://danburyhackerspace.com/) that aims to stimulate discussion in the vast field of artificial intelligence and bring together locals that foster a passion for the field. We hold our in person meetings on the first Tuesday of every month at which we host a variety of presenters, discussions, and workshops. We maintain a lively web presence via slack so the conversation never stops.
